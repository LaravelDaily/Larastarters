# Larastarters

Package to install a regular Laravel Starter Kit with a non-regular different design theme.

The package suggests to install [Laravel Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze) (Tailwind) or [Laravel UI](https://github.com/laravel/ui) (Bootstrap) starter kit, and adds the chosen design theme on top.

**Notice**: if you want more functionality than just the Starter Kit, check our premium product [QuickAdminPanel](https://quickadminpanel.com).

---

## Important

This package should be used **immediately after installing Laravel**. If you add any more functionality, like routes or controllers, they may get overridden by Larastarters.

---

## Usage

1. Install fresh Laravel project
2. Run `composer require laraveldaily/larastarters --dev`
3. Run `php artisan larastarters:install` - it will show a wizard to choose the starter kit and the theme (options are listed below)
4. Run `npm install && npm run dev`
5. That's it, you have Laravel Auth starter, just visit the home page and click Log in / Register

### Developing within a container

Internally this package runs several `php artisan` commands during the install process. This command may not work and the installation process hang if you are within a container. Alternatively, you may pass the `--artisan_command` flag to change this behaviour. For example: `php artisan larastarters:install --artisan_command=./vendor/bin/sail` or `php artisan larastarters:install --artisan_command=sail`.
